# All About the RENAISSANCE
Beyoncé Giselle Knowles-Carter, known as Beyoncé, release her 7th studio album on July 29th, 2022 by Parkwood Entertainment and Columbuia Records. She had this album in the making since the ==pandemic==, and stated that it is a three-act-project. This album is act i. She took inspiration from her late Uncle Johnny, who was gay. The album blends together with smooth transitions, from ==Black dance music== to ==R&B== to ==House music== which celebrates black and queer history. This album featured various artists such as Gace Jones, Tems, BEAM, and so on. Wither her remix of '==BREAK MY SOUL==', she paid homage to many female artists, ranging from her sister, Solange Knowles, to many iconic black icons. She also mentioned various major ballroom houses, House of Aviance, House of Telfar, House of Mugler, House of Balenciage, and so on.

She honored the black and queer community with this album, putting ballroom on a massive stage. She hired a diversity of dancers for her tour, even including her daughter Blue Ivy. Apparently, Blue's performance should have been a one-time thing, but her mother saw her commitment to dance and practice for this tour. Blue Ivy also saved the song "Diva" from getting booted out of the tour.
